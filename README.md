# WOC 7.0 Project Repository

This repository contains the project developed during Winter of Code 7.0 (WOC 7.0). It is organized into the following main folders:

1). Algorithms: Contains various algorithms implemented throughout the project. Each algorithm is well-documented and includes complete source code.
2). Predictions: Showcases the predictions generated using the final models developed during the course of the project.
3).Data: Includes the dataset(s) provided for training, validation, testing and making predictions.

Additionally, a comprehensive project report is included, detailing the full development process, methodologies used, and results obtained.

The repository is structured to provide a clear understanding of the project’s progression—from algorithm development to model training and final predictions. It serves as a complete resource for exploring the work and outcomes achieved during WOC 7.0.
