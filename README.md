# WOC 7.0 Project Repository

This repository contains the project developed during Winter of Code 7.0 (WOC 7.0). It is organized into the following main folders:
	•	Algorithms: Contains various algorithms implemented throughout the project. Each algorithm is well-documented and includes complete source code.
	•	Predictions: Showcases the predictions generated using the final models developed during the course of the project.
	•	Data: Includes the dataset(s) used for training, validation, and testing. This folder contains all the raw and/or processed data necessary to reproduce the results.

Additionally, a comprehensive project report is included, detailing the full development process, methodologies used, and results obtained.

The repository is structured to provide a clear understanding of the project’s progression—from algorithm development to model training and final predictions. It serves as a complete resource for exploring the work and outcomes achieved during WOC 7.0.
