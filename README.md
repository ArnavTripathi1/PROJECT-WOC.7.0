This repository contains the project developed during WOC 7.0 (Winter of Code). It is organized into two main folders:

1.	Algorithms:
This folder contains the various algorithms implemented throughout the project. Each algorithm is well-documented and includes source code.

2.	Predictions:
This folder showcases the predictions generated using the final models developed during the project.

A report of the complete development project is also included.

The repository is structured to provide a clear understanding of the project’s progression, from algorithm development to final predictions. It is a comprehensive resource for exploring the methods and results achieved by me during WOC 7.0.
